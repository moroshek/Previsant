        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
          A large regional health plan partnered with Previsant to modernize their payment integrity 
          program using advanced analytics and AI. The pilot program exceeded all expectations, 
          identifying over $20 million in savings opportunities within 60 days and projecting 
          $100+ million in annual benefits at full scale.
        </p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Our client, a health plan covering 2.5 million members, faced escalating challenges in 
          their payment integrity program:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Traditional rule-based systems catching only 2-3% of improper payments</li>
          <li>Rising medical costs outpacing detection capabilities</li>
          <li>Limited visibility into complex provider billing patterns</li>
          <li>Inability to detect sophisticated fraud schemes</li>
          <li>High false positive rates creating provider abrasion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Previsant implemented a comprehensive AI-powered payment integrity solution following our 
          proven methodology:
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 1: Data Integration & Enrichment</h3>
        <p>
          We began by integrating multiple data sources to create a 360-degree view:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>3 years of claims history (500M+ records)</li>
          <li>Provider credentialing and network data</li>
          <li>Member eligibility and demographics</li>
          <li>External benchmarking databases</li>
          <li>Public records and sanctions lists</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 2: AI Model Development</h3>
        <p>
          Our data science team developed multiple specialized models:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Unsupervised learning to identify unusual billing patterns</li>
          <li><strong>Fraud Prediction:</strong> Supervised models trained on confirmed fraud cases</li>
          <li><strong>Network Analysis:</strong> Graph algorithms to detect collusion rings</li>
          <li><strong>NLP Processing:</strong> Text analysis of clinical notes for medical necessity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 3: Pilot Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          We conducted a 60-day pilot focused on high-risk areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Durable medical equipment (DME)</li>
          <li>Home health services</li>
          <li>Outpatient facility billing</li>
          <li>High-cost specialty drugs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Results That Exceeded Expectations</h2>

        <h3>Financial Impact</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$20.3M</strong> in confirmed savings identified</li>
          <li><strong>$8.5M</strong> recovered within pilot period</li>
          <li><strong>$102M</strong> projected annual savings at full scale</li>
          <li><strong>15:1</strong> ROI on program investment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Operational Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>73%</strong> reduction in false positives</li>
          <li><strong>5x</strong> increase in investigator productivity</li>
          <li><strong>90%</strong> reduction in case review time</li>
          <li><strong>95%</strong> provider satisfaction maintained</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Findings by Category</h3>
        <p>
          Our AI models uncovered several systematic issues:
        </p>

        <h4>DME Billing (32% of savings)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Unbundling of equipment rentals</li>
          <li>Billing for purchase after rental limits</li>
          <li>Geographic impossibility patterns</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Home Health (28% of savings)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Services exceeding medical necessity</li>
          <li>Duplicate billing across disciplines</li>
          <li>Phantom visit patterns</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Facility Billing (25% of savings)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Upcoding of procedure complexity</li>
          <li>Inappropriate site of service</li>
          <li>Modifier abuse patterns</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Specialty Pharmacy (15% of savings)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Off-label usage without documentation</li>
          <li>Dosing outside clinical guidelines</li>
          <li>Coordination of benefits issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Success Factors</h2>
        <p>
          Several key factors contributed to the program's success:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Explainable AI Models</h3>
        <p>
          Every flagged claim included clear explanation of detection rationale, making it easy for 
          investigators to validate findings and defend decisions during appeals.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Provider Collaboration</h3>
        <p>
          We engaged providers early, sharing insights about billing errors and offering education 
          rather than just penalties, maintaining positive relationships.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Continuous Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Models improved weekly based on investigator feedback, rapidly adapting to new schemes 
          and reducing false positives.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Executive Sponsorship</h3>
        <p>
          Strong support from C-suite ensured resources and cross-functional collaboration needed 
          for rapid implementation.
        </p>

        <h2>Scaling for Maximum Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Following the pilot success, the client committed to full-scale implementation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expanding to all claim types and service categories</li>
          <li>Real-time scoring integration with claims processing</li>
          <li>Predictive models for prepayment intervention</li>
          <li>Provider scorecards and self-service portals</li>
          <li>Advanced visualization dashboards for executives</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
          This engagement reinforced several critical insights:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Start focused:</strong> Pilot programs in specific areas build confidence faster than broad implementations</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritize explainability:</strong> Black box models create operational challenges regardless of accuracy</li>
          <li><strong>Invest in change management:</strong> Technology is only 40% of the solution; people and process are critical</li>
          <li><strong>Measure comprehensively:</strong> Track both financial and operational metrics to demonstrate full value</li>
          <li><strong>Plan for scale:</strong> Architecture decisions in pilot phase determine scaling success</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
        <p>
          This case study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in payment integrity. 
          With the right approach, technology, and partners, health plans can achieve step-function 
          improvements in both financial performance and operational efficiency while maintaining 
          positive provider relationships.
